This competition was developed in response to the release of [XPRIZE's Future of Food Impact Roadmap](google.cl), an in-depth analysis of global food system challenges that identified 12 radical breakthroughs which could establish a more food secure and environmentally sustainable world by 2050. The critical impact area that XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion addresses is the need for alternative proteins at-scale.
